Hey there! Thanks for downloading my save file! This is the 100% COMPLETE Save for Mario's Madness v2.0.1, meaning all the songs are unlocked, all cutscenes are unlocked, and the story mode and overworld have been cleared. Anyways, here's how to apply this save file:

Head to this pathway:
C:\Users\(YourUserHere)\AppData\Roaming\ninjamuffin99
(Easiest way to get to this pathway is if you're on Windows, press Windows Key + R, and type %appdata%.)

After that, simply drag and drop these 2 files to the aforementioned pathway:
controls.sol
funkin.sol

That's it! You're done! 

Important Notices:
It's worth noting that this save file was set to downscroll and this file was heavily optimized to put as little stress on the RAM as possible, so if you wanna make any changes, just head to the options menu.

They keybinds are as follows:
Left: Z
Down: X
Up: ,
Right: .
